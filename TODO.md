# TO DO

## bugs

## improvements

 * measure character images automatically
 * Use CSS transformations to horizontally flip images when we need to
  * need to make it handle multi-part transforms (when there's a magnify setting, for example)
 * clean up the fonts we're using â€“ does OTF actually work everywhere?

## features

 * Some kind of progress meter?
 * way to set it playing automatically if so desired
 * better controls

## offshoots

 * A way to graphically create bookdata.js information rather than doing it manually
