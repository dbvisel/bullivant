# TO DO

## bugs

## improvements

 * measure character images automatically
 * Use CSS transformations to horizontally flip images when we need to
  * need to make it handle multi-part transforms (when there's a magnify setting, for example)
 * clean up the fonts we're using â€“ does OTF actually work everywhere?
 * make some kind of gesture towards supporting mobile
 * add script to clean/downsize images
 * should bookfiles have their own settings object? For autoplay probably?

## features

 * Some kind of progress meter?
 * way to set it playing automatically if so desired
 * better controls
 * audio?
 * change bookfile to JSON on a server rather than as a module

## offshoots

 * A way to graphically create bookdata.js information rather than doing it manually
